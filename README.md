<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.
You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.
You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.
Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->

<!-- Your project is gaining traction and it is being used by thousands of people(***with this README there will be even more***). Now it would be a good time to look for people or organisations to sponsor your project. This could be because you are not generating any revenue from your project and you require money for keeping the project alive.
You could add how people can sponsor your project in this section. Add your patreon or GitHub sponsor link here for easy access.
A good idea is to also display the sponsors with their organisation logos or badges to show them your love!(*Someday I will get a sponsor and I can show my love*) -->
